JavaScript/SVG plotting library

In this project my goal is to create a plotting library for so I simple plots can be generated relatively easily in JavaScript code.

I started this project this evening, Tuesday April 7th 2015.

Scatter plots, line graphs, box plots, histograms, pie charts etc are the basics of what I would like to achieve.
