List of Features I'd like to add more or less in the order I'd like/expect to get to them

1. A method to read in delimited files and generate a dataset object
2. General features for adding titles for the graph, x and y axes. 
3. Add x and y values to the grid lines. 
4. Additional types of graphs
    a. Box plots
    b. Histograms
5. General clean up of existing code.
6. Error handling and the addition of sensible default behaviors.
7. Have automatic/intelligent grid lines/axes deduced and plotted from the data
8. Operations to filter, concatenate and join data sets.
